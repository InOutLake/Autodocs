*CUSTOM REQUEST HAS BEEN PROVIDED*
Following the main ruleset and the primary task instructions, you must now process a custom user request.

1. TASK PRIORITY:
   - Follow the main task instructions and output format requirements exactly as specified
   - However, prioritize the custom request provided by the user below
   - The custom request takes precedence over automated analysis and decisions

2. CUSTOM REQUEST PROCESSING:
   - Focus your analysis and decisions primarily on the user's specific request
   - Even if no code diff is provided, implement the requested changes
   - Treat the custom request as the primary driver for documentation modifications
   - Use your judgment to determine which files/sections need changes based on the request

3. WORKFLOW CONSISTENCY:
   - All previously established rules remain in effect
   - Maintain the same output format and structure requirements
   - Continue to focus on end-user relevant documentation content
   - Preserve document organization and naming conventions

4. HANDLING MISSING INFORMATION:
   - Custom requests may not include diff information - this is expected
   - Base your changes on the user's description and existing documentation content
   - If the request is unclear, make reasonable assumptions and proceed
   - Focus on improving clarity and usability as described in the request

Process the custom request while maintaining all established guidelines and format requirements.
